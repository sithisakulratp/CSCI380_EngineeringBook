	1991 - Listermann Brewing was founded by husband and wife Dan and Sue Listermann. Dan began manufacturing home brew parts and shipping them throughout the country. This was done at the Hamilton County Business Center (which is visible out of the front doors of the tap room).
	1995 - Our current building was purchased and the home brew store opened. This home brew shop is still on premises today (although in a different location).
	2008 - A 2 BBL brew house was purchased by Dan from a cold call he received from someone looking to sell one. The brewery opens its doors, with 2 2 BBL fermenters seen in the background of the picture above.
	2014 - Nutcase Peanut Butter Porter wins a bronze medal at GABF

	2016 - Chickow! wins a gold medal at FoBAB and also wins Best in Show
	2017 - Chickow! wins a gold medal at FoBAB and also wins Runner up for Best in Show

	THE FULL, UNABRIDGED STORY STRAIGHT FROM DAN. THIS STORY IS MORE FUN IF YOU READ IT WITH A BEER IN HAND WHILE WEARING A MONOCLE!:
	In the spring of 1973, I was an engineering student at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio and walked into a drug store noticing a beer making kit on a shelf….

	Additional Information:
	They posted many videos of trending topics and song covers (ex: Drake’s “In My Feelings” challenge and using Bird Scooters) and 	also updated their hours and quantity on special occasions and days.

 ### 2) Physical Location
	The location of Listermann Brewing Company is on 1621 Dana Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45207 (Corners on Idlewild Ave and Newton Ave). Trash cans on Idlewild Ave. near back end of the building and near a driveway and the start of the residential street also visible below the mural on the same side of building. The restaurant is a bar style, and like any other bars, only those 21 years of age and older can purchase alcohol. They frequently have special events which could make choosing a time to be inconspicuous in a large crowd.
	More than that, they have an outdoor picnic table area, which has “loud” music, so having conversations out there might be difficult. Regardless of loud noise, it could provide a good cover for a more private conversation. They also have a large parking lot (as stated in google reviews). Their hours are as shown below:
	Mon-Tue: 10:00 am - 8:00 pm
	Wed-Thu: 10:00 am - 9:00 pm
	Fri-Sat: 10:00 am - 11:00 pm
	Sun: 12:00 pm - 8:00 pm

 ### 4) Information Technology
	Listermann’s website is hosted by Wordpress, so their website is not secured. The html source on the pages includes copyright information for the hosting company. When checking website on archive.org (the Wayback Machine), it does not show any results. However, the website archive-it.org gives results of media content that Listermann was mentioned. Since we do not have many results on the Wayback Machine, we cannot track as to how long the website has been hosted by the hosting company. Besides its website, Listermann’s information is also available through Yelp.com. Overall, Listermann Brewing Company does not appear to have many services on the Internet aside from the hosted web site and emails.

# WEEK 4
## 9.11.18
 - Introduction to Network Scanning
### Bash Commands ++
 #### Safety Checks Commands
 - ```ip route``` - a command used to display Kali's machine table
 - ```ip route del default``` - command used to delete the default route
 #### Identify Yourself Commands
 - ```ifconfig``` - command used to display Kali's machine's interfaces along with the IP addresses
 - The network segment of the target network from the lab is 172.28.128.0/24
 #### Identify Life System Commands
 - ```nmap -n -sn -PR 172.28.128.0/24```
 	- ```nmap``` or Network Mapper: a free and open-source security scanner used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus building a "map" of the network
	- ```-n``` - command tells nmap to NEVER do DNS reolution/always resovle [default: sometimes]
	- ```-sn``` - commands tells nmap to do a port can after host discovery, and only print out the available hosts that respond to the host discovery probes. This is commonly known as a "ping scan."
	- ```-PR``` - Also known as ARP Ping or Neighbor Discovery. It scans for an Ethernet LAN. It is done by default against targets on a local Ethernet network even if you specify other -P* options, because it is almost always faster and more effective.
 - ```arp-scan -I eth1 172.28.128.0/24``` - a very fast ARP packet scanner that shows every active IPv4 devices on your subnet. Cool thing about arp-scan is that it shows all active devices even if they have firewalls. Devices cannot hide from ARP packets like they hide from Ping.
 	- ```-I``` is short for interface.
 #### Identify Listening Services
 - ```nmap -sS 172.28.128.5```
 	- ```-sS``` is used for a half-open scan.
 - ```unicornscan -msf 172.28.128.5``` is used to perform a TCP Connect Scan (note that this is different than TCP Scan)
 #### Analyze ARP vs. Open Scan
 - Performed in Wireshark
 - **ARP Scan**: (```arp-scan -I eth1 <target network>```)
 	- the packet that represents the test to see if the machine is active is the ARP Request, the one asking "Who has ...?"
	- the packet that represents the answer, if the machine is active is the ARP Reply (usually the one right after the request)
	- there is no such packet that represents the answer, if the machine is _not_ active.
 - **The Half-Open Scan**: (```nmap -sS <target network>```)
 	- the packet that represents the test to see if the machine is active is the [SYN].
		- specifically, ```58 33657 -> 23 [SYN] ...```
	- the packet that represents the answer, if the machine is active is the [SYN, ACK] and then [RST]
		- specifically, ```60 23 -> 33657 [SYN, ACK] ...```
				```54 33657 -> 23 [RST] ...```
	- the packet that represents the answer, if the machine is _not_ active is [SYN] and then [RST, ACK]
		- specifically, ```58 33657 -> 8000 [SYN] ...```
				```60 8080 -> 33657 [RST, ACK] ...```

# Week 5
## 9.18.18
- Social Engineering
	- Types of Social Engineering
	- Insider Threats
	- Impersonation: Social networking
	- Identity Theft
	- Countermeasures
- There are internal and external social engineering
	- In class video "Betrayed," we learned about an insider threat from within a company and how to spot the behaviors that would be a threat to the company.
	- The movie really helped me learn about this topic!
	
# Week 6
## 9.25.18
 - The biggest confusion for me for this topic was the difference between router, switch and hub
 	- **Router**:
		- operate at the network layer (3)
		- forwards data packets along networks
		- is connected to at least two network segments (subnets)
		- are located at gateways
		- use protocols to communicate with each other and configure the best route between any two hosts
	- **Switch**:
		- filters AND forwards packets between LAN segments
		- operate at the data link layer (2) of the OSI Reference Model
		- sometimes operate at layer 3 (network) to bblur distinction and performs line speed routing
	- **Hub**:
		- operate at the physical layers (1)
		- common connection point for devices in a network
		- contains multiple ports (this is where when a packet arrives at one port, it's copied to all other ports so that all segments of the LAN can see all packets)

 - **Sniffing, ARP Poisoning**
 	- Sniffing is interception and logging of network traffic (the lab)
		- in the lab, we used Kali as the attacker, Kali-clone as the target, and Metasploitable2 as web server.
			ARP Spoof MITM Attack --> Ettercap, tcpdump
			Man-in-the-Middle (Track the use of web serer of the target)
- **DHCP Attack** - we used to attack DHCP servers
	1. DHCP client discovers DHCP server
	2. DHCP server offers/provides address, subnet, gateway, DNS, timer server, and more to the client
	3. DHCP client requests
	4. DHCP server then acknowledge the client

# WEEK 7
## 10.02.18
- Vulnerability Scanning with Nikto Lab
	- I had no problem with this lab. The lab was clear and makes sense.

# WEEK 8
## 10.09.18
- Metasploit and Password Crcking with John the Ripper Lab
	- In Metasploit, we ued kali and winxpie8 VM boxes
		- For winxpie8, I (and most of the class) had trouble with firing up the windows.
			 - We solved it using what Kevin has in his Engineering Notebook,
			 	- "Rearm Windows XP Grace Period"
				
	- In John the Ripper Lab, we used kali and kali-clone for VM boxes
		- This lab was very interesting.
	
# WEEK 9
## 10.16.18
- C and Assembly Part 1 Lab
	- The class was going a little too slow and we didn't really cover all the lab. It would be helpful if we could just go over the questions and explain what you were trying to ask when we are running out of time. Otherwise, the class is going just right for me.
	
# WEEK 10
## 10.23.18
- C and Assembly Part 2 Lab
	- The lab was a little more challenging because we had to compare and contrast the assembly languages, MIPs and ARMs
	- This week, class was going just right. This is also because the solution from the previous lab helps guide this lab.
  
# WEEK 11
## 10.30.18
- We started to learn about IDA Pro Freeware, the popular disassembler for reverse engineer
 	- This class was going just the right pace but I wish we could do more examples on IDA Pro
	
# WEEK 12
## 11.06.18
- I was not in class this week, but I believed the class went over more on IDA Pro Freeware and did more examples on how to use it to reverse engineer the bomb challenge
	- Also, the walkthrough video for the password challenge assignment was very helpful
	
# WEEK 13
## 11.13.18
- More on IDA Pro Freeware in class. That was helpful for me to understand more about the assembly
