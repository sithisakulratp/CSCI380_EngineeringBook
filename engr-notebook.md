	1991 - Listermann Brewing was founded by husband and wife Dan and Sue Listermann. Dan began manufacturing home brew parts and shipping them throughout the country. This was done at the Hamilton County Business Center (which is visible out of the front doors of the tap room).
	1995 - Our current building was purchased and the home brew store opened. This home brew shop is still on premises today (although in a different location).
	2008 - A 2 BBL brew house was purchased by Dan from a cold call he received from someone looking to sell one. The brewery opens its doors, with 2 2 BBL fermenters seen in the background of the picture above.

	THE FULL, UNABRIDGED STORY STRAIGHT FROM DAN. THIS STORY IS MORE FUN IF YOU READ IT WITH A BEER IN HAND WHILE WEARING A MONOCLE!:
	In the spring of 1973, I was an engineering student at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio and walked into a drug store noticing a beer making kit on a shelf….

	Additional Information:
	They posted many videos of trending topics and song covers (ex: Drake’s “In My Feelings” challenge and using Bird Scooters) and 	also updated their hours and quantity on special occasions and days.

 ### 2) Physical Location
	The location of Listermann Brewing Company is on 1621 Dana Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45207 (Corners on Idlewild Ave and Newton Ave). Trash cans on Idlewild Ave. near back end of the building and near a driveway and the start of the residential street also visible below the mural on the same side of building. The restaurant is a bar style, and like any other bars, only those 21 years of age and older can purchase alcohol. They frequently have special events which could make choosing a time to be inconspicuous in a large crowd.
	More than that, they have an outdoor picnic table area, which has “loud” music, so having conversations out there might be difficult. Regardless of loud noise, it could provide a good cover for a more private conversation. They also have a large parking lot (as stated in google reviews). Their hours are as shown below:
	Mon-Tue: 10:00 am - 8:00 pm
	Wed-Thu: 10:00 am - 9:00 pm
	Fri-Sat: 10:00 am - 11:00 pm
	Sun: 12:00 pm - 8:00 pm

When checking website on archive.org (the Wayback Machine), it does not show any results. However, the website archive-it.org gives results of media content that Listermann was mentioned. Since we do not have many results on the Wayback Machine, we cannot track as to how long the website has been hosted by the hosting company.

# WEEK 4
## 9.11.18
 - Introduction to Network Scanning
### Bash Commands ++
 #### Safety Checks Commands
 - ```ip route``` - a command used to display Kali's machine table
 - ```ip route del default``` - command used to delete the default route
 #### Identify Yourself Commands
 - ```ifconfig``` - command used to display Kali's machine's interfaces along with the IP addresses
 - The network segment of the target network from the lab is 172.28.128.0/24
 #### Identify Life System Commands
 - ```nmap -n -sn -PR 172.28.128.0/24```
 	- ```nmap``` or Network Mapper: a free and open-source security scanner used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus building a "map" of the network
	- ```-n``` - command tells nmap to NEVER do DNS reolution/always resovle [default: sometimes]
	- ```-sn``` - commands tells nmap to do a port can after host discovery, and only print out the available hosts that respond to the host discovery probes. This is commonly known as a "ping scan."
	- ```-PR``` - Also known as ARP Ping or Neighbor Discovery. It scans for an Ethernet LAN. It is done by default against targets on a local Ethernet network even if you specify other -P* options, because it is almost always faster and more effective.
 - ```arp-scan -I eth1 172.28.128.0/24``` - a very fast ARP packet scanner that shows every active IPv4 devices on your subnet. Cool thing about arp-scan is that it shows all active devices even if they have firewalls. Devices cannot hide from ARP packets like they hide from Ping.
 	- ```-I``` is short for interface.
 #### Identify Listening Services
 - ```nmap -sS 172.28.128.5```
 	- ```-sS``` is used for a half-open scan.
 - ```unicornscan -msf 172.28.128.5``` is used to perform a TCP Connect Scan (note that this is different than TCP Scan)
 #### Analyze ARP vs. Open Scan
 - Performed in Wireshark
 - **ARP Scan**: (```arp-scan -I eth1 <target network>```)
 	- the packet that represents the test to see if the machine is active is the ARP Request, the one asking "Who has ...?"
	- the packet that represents the answer, if the machine is active is the ARP Reply (usually the one right after the request)
	- there is no such packet that represents the answer, if the machine is _not_ active.
 - **The Half-Open Scan**: (```nmap -sS <target network>```)
 	- the packet that represents the test to see if the machine is active is the [SYN].
		- specifically, ```58 33657 -> 23 [SYN] ...```
	- the packet that represents the answer, if the machine is active is the [SYN, ACK] and then [RST]
		- specifically, ```60 23 -> 33657 [SYN, ACK] ...```
				```54 33657 -> 23 [RST] ...```
	- the packet that represents the answer, if the machine is _not_ active is [SYN] and then [RST, ACK]
		- specifically, ```58 33657 -> 8000 [SYN] ...```
				```60 8080 -> 33657 [RST, ACK] ...```
