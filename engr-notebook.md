	1991 - Listermann Brewing was founded by husband and wife Dan and Sue Listermann. Dan began manufacturing home brew parts and shipping them throughout the country. This was done at the Hamilton County Business Center (which is visible out of the front doors of the tap room).
	1995 - Our current building was purchased and the home brew store opened. This home brew shop is still on premises today (although in a different location).
	2008 - A 2 BBL brew house was purchased by Dan from a cold call he received from someone looking to sell one. The brewery opens its doors, with 2 2 BBL fermenters seen in the background of the picture above.

	THE FULL, UNABRIDGED STORY STRAIGHT FROM DAN. THIS STORY IS MORE FUN IF YOU READ IT WITH A BEER IN HAND WHILE WEARING A MONOCLE!:
	In the spring of 1973, I was an engineering student at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio and walked into a drug store noticing a beer making kit on a shelf….

	Additional Information:
	They posted many videos of trending topics and song covers (ex: Drake’s “In My Feelings” challenge and using Bird Scooters) and 	also updated their hours and quantity on special occasions and days.

 ### 2) Physical Location
	The location of Listermann Brewing Company is on 1621 Dana Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45207 (Corners on Idlewild Ave and Newton Ave). Trash cans on Idlewild Ave. near back end of the building and near a driveway and the start of the residential street also visible below the mural on the same side of building. The restaurant is a bar style, and like any other bars, only those 21 years of age and older can purchase alcohol. They frequently have special events which could make choosing a time to be inconspicuous in a large crowd.
	More than that, they have an outdoor picnic table area, which has “loud” music, so having conversations out there might be difficult. Regardless of loud noise, it could provide a good cover for a more private conversation. They also have a large parking lot (as stated in google reviews). Their hours are as shown below:
	Mon-Tue: 10:00 am - 8:00 pm
	Wed-Thu: 10:00 am - 9:00 pm
	Fri-Sat: 10:00 am - 11:00 pm
	Sun: 12:00 pm - 8:00 pm

Since we do not have many results on the Wayback Machine, we cannot track as to how long the website has been hosted by the hosting company.

Overall, Listermann Brewing Company does not appear to have many services on the Internet aside from the hosted web site and emails.
